If you use the code, feel free to let me know. For using the assets, please credit either Kenney (art) or CarpetBakery (song).

This does require some custom edits to Aidan's ECS library. If you're that interested, I can share. The edits are temporary, and I want to remove them.

(I'll be adding a writeup soon)
